We developed this project using Visual Studio Code and the Python programming language. We wrote the entire project as one Python code, but we utilized the threading dictionary for simultaneous socket listening and file transfer and chunk anouncments. Throughout the development process, we encountered a couple of challenges. Initially, one issue was that we kept the buffer size small, resulting in incomplete and corrupted file transfers. Another problem we faced was the inability to share files with other groups' projects.
